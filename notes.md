# Be Friends With Your Designers And Style Guides

### Abstract

When you are a developer you sometimes struggle to understand what designers are asking you for. As a designer you ask yourself why developers cannot just do what you expect.
To deliver good work it is important to understand each other. On this foundation a lot of problems can be avoided in advance.
Enter the world of style guides and see how they can improve this cooperation.

	- What are Style Guides and how can we use them?
- Friendship
	- You mostly never work alone in web development
	- you form a team with others
	- working in a team is about being friends with each other
	- because teams need friendships
	- Let us look at some examples:
		- Pokémon
			- Team Rocket
				- Mission: obtaining powerful and rare Pokémon, someday taking over the world.
			- Ash & Co.
		- A-Team
			- run from the Army after being branded for a "crime they didn't commit"
	- Sometimes friendships are hard
	- It's hard to work in teams
	- Who doesn't know sentences like
		- "Are you even listening"
		- "You never admit you're wrong"
	- In oder to become friends within a team there are little helpers
	- One of them are style guides
	- To understand them, let's look a bit back in hisory
- History
	- Corporate Identiy
		- Religion:
			- the Christian cross
				- Weihrauch als Geruch
			- the Judaic Star of David
			- the Islamic crescent moon
		- Kings and nobles in medieval times
			- clothing, armor, flags, shields, tableware and so on
	- Simple graphics became more and more important for professions through the 16th century
		- Example: Caduceus for physicians
			- Which has it's own Unicode sign nowadays (U+2624)
		- government offices were established throughout Europe to register and protect trademarks
	- trademarking for businesses: spread heavily during the Industrial Revolution
	- In the 20th century nearly every company had a corporate identity
		- Publishers establish rules for language use, such as spelling, italics and punctuation
			- consistency
		- In univerities: Schoolars are asked to stick to guide lines when publishing something
		- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide
		- Lufthansa Styleguide from 1962 - Ulmer Studie
			- General usage of the logo and word mark for all products
			- From PDF to online -> open style guide
- Why do we need them?
- And what's the value for us as designers and developers?
	- Lufthansa had a lot of freelancers
	- New people on teams had it easier

	- To keep the friendship
		- removing questions like
			- "Are you even listening"
				- better communication with Style Guides
			- "You never admit you're wrong"

- Examples
	- DGU
		- German association for emergency surgery


* Game
	* All stand up
	* Who does only design
	* Who does only code
	* Who does neither?
	* Everyone else knows how they have to fight their inner dev or designer to accept the opinion of the other "soul"

- Fighting something is always bad
- Fighting has a bad influence on what you do
- But struggeling with other peoples opinion is normal
- Because we are all different
- Find a consensus together
- When working in a team…
	- it's important to create guidelines together
	- Because we are all experts
	- Together… because it is hard to change your own opinion
	- Stanford Uni study (http://piee.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/docs/behavior/workshop/2008/presentations/03-02_New_Research_on_Behavior_Change.pdf)
	- How to change behavior
		- Biological reasons and logical thinking.
		- Choice and models of agency.
		- Social belonging.
		- Goals and feedback.
	- Learning from each other to become better
- What are Style Guides for developers?
	- Coding Guidelines / Coding style
		- Why?
			- Maintenance
			- Improve readbility and understanding.
		- How?
			- Best practices.
			- Use resources.
		- Maybe look at a style guide?

	* Game
		* Who builds Websites?
		* Who builds Webapps?
		* Who works on their companies own project?
		* Who does style guides?
		* Conclusion: For websites is sometimes hard to develop style guides because of budgeting reasons
			* Large scale web-apps and projects demand a style guide in order to keep everyone in the team on board

	- Building separate components
		- Don't think about what the context is but what a widget does
		- We know this from jQuery plugins for examples
		- Component libraries
			- are User Interface Libraries
				- For forms, buttons, widgets on a site
			- Pros
				- You can build stuff pretty fast
			- Cons
				- Might do a lot more than you need
			- Bootstrap
				- Component: menu
		- You can share code for components throughout style guides and the website

- Design in the browser
	- Make a website Future Proof
	- Maintainance
		- Using style guides to communicate changes with customers

- When we stick to guide lines we set our selfs, we become better in what we do
	- And in connection with team member
- We don't have to fight over decisions if there are already good decisions made for us
	- Especially if decisions are influenced by us

- And so… you can become a great team as the A-Team.
- Being friends rather than discussing and fighting
